# Accelerated C++
## Chapter 7 Exercise 9

>The implementation of nrand in ยง7.4.4/135 will not work for arguments greater
>than `RAND_MAX`. Usually, this restriction is no problem, because `RAND_MAX` is often the
>largest possible integer anyway. Nevertheless, there are implementations under which
>`RAND_MAX` is much smaller than the largest possible integer. For example, it is not
>uncommon for `RAND_MAX` to be 32767 (215 -1) and the largest possible integer to be
>2147483647 (231 -1). Reimplement nrand so that it works well for all values of n.

Using a multipler solves this problem:
```cpp
int multiplier = n / RAND_MAX + 1;
if (n % RAND_MAX != 0)
{
    ++multiplier;
}
```
