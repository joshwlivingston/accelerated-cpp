## Chapter 7 Exercise 1

>Extend the program from ยง7.2/124 to produce its output sorted by occurrence count. That
>is, the output should group all the words that occur once, followed by those that occur twice,
>and so on.

Implemented in `main.cc`. We add a second map creation, after reading the input, to group the 
words by occurence count.
