Implemented in `student_info.cc`

>How does the performance of this version compare with the one in ยง5.1.1/77?

Due to the insertion of an element at the begining of a vector begin core to this 
rewrite, the program is considerably slower. While the original `vector` version ran
in less than half of a second, this rewrite using `insert()` and `resize()` takes over
2.5 seconds.
