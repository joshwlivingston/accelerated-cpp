# Accelerated C++
## Chapter 05 Exercise 11

In text processing it is sometimes useful to know whether a word has any
ascenders or descenders. Ascenders are the parts of lowercase letters that
extend above the text line; in the English alphabet, the letters b, d, f, h, k
l, and t have ascenders. Similarly, the descenders are the parts of lowercase
letters that descend below the line; In English, the letters g, j, p, q, and y
have descenders. Write a program to determine whether a word has any ascenders
or descenders. Extend that program to find the longest word in the dictionary
that has neither ascenders nor descenders.

### Longest words without ascenders or desenders
After scanning [this list](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words) of english 
words, three words were identified as longest, at 18 characters long:
- **noncarnivorousness**
- **nonceremoniousness**
- **overcensoriousness**
