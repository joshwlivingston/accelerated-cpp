# Accelerated C++
## Chapter 6 Exercises 7-8

### Exercise 7
>The portion of the grading analysis program from ยง6.2.1/110 that read and classified
>student records depending on whether they did (or did not) do all the homework is similar to
>the problem we solved in `extract_fails`. Write a function to handle this subproblem.

### Exercise 8
>Write a single function that can be used to classify students based on criteria of your
>choice. Test this function by using it in place of the extract_fails program, and use it in the
program to analyze student grades.

### Answer 
Implemented as `extract(const vector<StudentInfo> &, bool f(const StudentInfo &))` in 
`student_info.cc` , using `stable_partition()` and `erase()`.

Using algorithms resulted in concise, performant code. It would be nice to make `extract()` a 
type-agnostic generic.
