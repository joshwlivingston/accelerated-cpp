# Accelerated C++
## Chapter 6 Sections 2-3

### Section 06.02
Our aim is to modify the Student grading program so that we may:

1. Read all the student records, separating the students who did all the 
   homework from the others.
2. Apply each of the grading schemes to all the students in each group, and 
   report the median grade of each group.

### Section 06.03
We will re-implement extract_fails() using a specialized library algorithm.
