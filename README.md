# Accelerated C++: Practical Programming by Example

Andrew Koenig and Barbara Moo's 
[*Accelerated C++: Practical Programming by Example*](https://www.informit.com/store/accelerated-c-plus-plus-practical-programming-by-example-9780201703535)
is an intermediate introduction to the C++ standard library, best serving those
with prior programming experience.

I am using *Accelerated C++* as my introduction to C++; it fits my prior
experience. Having learned programming through learning the
[tidyverse](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), I resonate with the 
[abstraction-first style](https://accu.org/bookreviews/2000/glassborow_1185/)
of *Accelerated C++*.

This book was written in 2000 and uses C++98. While the core concepts still
apply, C++ has evolved significantly since that time, 
[especially with C++11](https://medium.com/@chittaranjansethi/c-98-vs-c-11-vs-c-17-evolution-and-enhancements-b187556b7c65).
I will benefit from my next read covering modern C++.

## Notes and Exercise Solutions

My notes and exercise solutions can be found inside the project folders,
organized by chapter/program.

## Build
Build all programs using [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/):
```
cmake --build .
```

### Executable names

With the exception of `say.exe` for section 10.04, all programs are named
according to their section/exercise. For example, the program for Chapter 8,
exercise 2 is named `ex-08-02`, and the program for chapter 10 section 1.1 is
called `sec-10-01-01`.
