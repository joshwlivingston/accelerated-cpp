# Accelerated C++

This repository contains my notes and exercises from Andrew Koenig and Barbara Moo's
[Accelerated C++: Practical Programming by Example](https://www.informit.com/store/accelerated-c-plus-plus-practical-programming-by-example-9780201703535).

*Accelerated C++* serves those with prior programming experience as an intermediate 
introduction to the c++ standard library. This book was written in 2000 and uses 
C++98. While the core concepts still apply, C++ has evolved significantly since that 
time. I will benefit from my next read covering modern C++.

I am using this as my introduction to C++; it fits my prior experience. Having learned 
programming through learning the [tidyverse](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), I resonate with
the abstraction-forward style of *Accelerated C++*.

## Build
Each program is separated into its own exectuable, separated by section/exercise. 

Build all programs using [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/):
```
cmake --build .
```
