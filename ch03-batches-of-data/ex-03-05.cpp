/*
Write a program that will keep track of grades for several students at once. The program
could keep two vectors in sync: The first should hold the student's names, and the second the
final grades that can be computed as input is read. For now, you should assume a fixed
number of homework grades. We'll see in ยง4.1.3/56 how to handle a variable number of
grades intermixed with student names.
