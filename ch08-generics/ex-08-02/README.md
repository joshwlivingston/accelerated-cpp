# Accelerated C++
## Chapter 8 Exercise 2

>Implement the following library algorithms, which we used in Chapter 6 and described in
>ยง6.5/121. Specify what kinds of iterators they require. Try to minimize the number of distinct
>iterator operations that each function requires. After you have finished your implementation,
>see ยงB.3/321 to see how well you did.

- `equal(b, e, d)`
- `search(b, e, b2, e2)`
- `find(b, e, t)`
- `find_if(b, e, p)`
- `copy(b, e, d)`
- `remove_copy(b, e, d, t)`
- `remove_copy_if(b, e, d, p)`
- `remove(b, e, t)`
- `transform(b, e, d, f)`
- `partition(b, e, p)`
- `accumulate(b, e, t)`
